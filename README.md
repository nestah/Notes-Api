# Notes-Api
This is a Notes Api built using the Django rest framework that performs CRUD operations to a registered model associated with all the endpoint views.
A part of this api uses jsonResponse to show the static json objects of endpoints.
The other part involves creating the endpoint views that serializes our model fields into json objects.
